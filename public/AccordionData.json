The poker part is being done through object oriented principals, starting at with the Game class. The Game class is responsible for handling game states: generating hands, cycling through hands, determining winning hands, etc. There is also a Player class for handling a specific player's state, such as what cards they have and what actions they take. The websocket will be split in the host, which runs the game class, and the client class, which the players run."

It is a web app that serves as a trading platform for players of the Magic the Gathering trading card game. The app works like a digital marketplace where users can upload their collection, search for cards they want, and offer to trade cards with other users. I was involved with most of the front end development, designing many of the page layouts and overall UI. I also designed the API calls to the Scryfall API, where we got data about the card (including images and pricing)."

            "Description": "Inspired by the recent COVID pandemic, I wanted to create a way to simulate virus transmission within a population. To this end, I created the Contagion Simulator. The program works by taking in a variety of user set factors, such as population size, lethality, and immunity. It then runs randomly generated cycles to see various outcomes of those inputs. For example, if a user wanted to see what effect natural immunity header on the spread of a virus, they could set the built up immunity value to really high. The UI is built through the Pygame library."

The goal of this project was to take a fictional programming langauge and convert it into executable Java code. This was done by taking the fictional code through a series of steps: breaking the text down into tokens through regex, grouping the tokens into abstract syntax trees, type checking the values, and finally transalting from there. The Calculator is built on that premise. The user provides a mathematical expression that is ran through a similar series of steps, except a calulation is made instead of translating to Java code. The UI was done through JFrame and testing was done through JUnit."
